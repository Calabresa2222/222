## Contributing
This Polymer element is written in ECMAScript 6. The repository includes a gulpfile that uses babel and other tools to transcompile the ECMAScript 6 code to ECMAScript 5 code. If you want to contribute run `gulp` in your terminal before you test your changes in browsers that lack support for ES6.
